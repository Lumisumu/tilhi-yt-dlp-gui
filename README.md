# Tilhi - yt-dlp GUI

Tilhi is an easy-to-use graphic use interface for yt-dlp and ffmpeg. Download videos in multiple different video and audio formats. Project goal is to make a handy tool for my friend who has had difficulty using command-line programs.

"Tilhi" is a bird that only shows itself during Autumn, in English it's name is "bohemian waxwing".

Available in English and Finnish.

## User installation

Download the zip from Releases and extract it into folder of your choice.

Download yt-dlp.exe: https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases

Download ffmpeg: https://github.com/yt-dlp/FFmpeg-Builds/releases

Extract ffmpeg folder. Move both yt-dlp.exe and ffmpeg.exe to the same folder where tilhi.exe is.

Launch program by double clicking Tilhi.

## How to use

Only required input field is the url address of the video page you want to download from. Videos are downloaded in webm file format.

You can also make a clip by filling timestamp field and it uses HH:MM:SS format. Only ending timestamp is required, starting timestamp starts from 00:00:00 by default. Empty fields are filled with "00".

After making a clip, you can make another one by filling in new timestamps. The same full video will not be downloaded again if the full video is still in the folder, only new clip is created.

If you check the audio-only option, both full video and the clips are downloaded in audio-only format. Audio file format is m4a.

If you check the delete original option, the full version is deleted and only clips are kept.

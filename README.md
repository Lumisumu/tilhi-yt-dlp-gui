# Tilhi - yt-dlp GUI

Tilhi is an easy-to-use graphic use interface for yt-dlp and ffmpeg. Download videos in multiple different video and audio formats. Project goal is to make a handy tool for my friend who has had difficulty using command-line programs.

"Tilhi" is a bird that only shows itself during Autumn, in English it's name is "bohemian waxwing".

## User installation

Download Tilhi.exe from Releases.

Download yt-dlp.exe: https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases

Download ffmpeg: https://github.com/yt-dlp/FFmpeg-Builds/releases

Extract ffmpeg folder. Move both yt-dlp.exe and ffmpeg.exe to the same folder where tilhi.exe is.

Launch program by double clicking Tilhi.

## How to use

Only required field is url address. There are also option for audio track only and making a clip.

If you want to make multiple clips of the same video, wait until the download is finished and add new timestamps while the same url is in the field. This will not download the video multiple times, it will only create a clip if the same video is found in the folder.
